#Incomplete Three Word Story Game

Please create `story.h` and `story.cpp` to finish developing the "three word story" game.

In case you can't guess the rules here is how it works:

 * Each round the next player gives you three words to add to your story.
 * The story moves creatively from person to person.

Make it happen!  (Then play it with a neighbor.)
